# Bangla Sign Language Translator (Real-time)

A real-time Bangla Sign Language (BdSL) recognition system I built from scratch to help the 2.5 million+ hearing-impaired people in Bangladesh communicate more easily.

### What it does
- Recognizes all Bangla alphabets (অ to হ) + common words (hello, thank you, I love you, etc.)
- Works live with any laptop/phone webcam
- Shows the detected sign in Bengali text + speaks it out loud using Bangla voice
- 94% accuracy on my own collected dataset (over 3,000 images)

### Tech stack
- Python, MediaPipe Hands, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras
- Custom CNN model + transfer learning
- gTTS for Bangla text-to-speech

### Live Demo Video (15 sec)

This project is very close to my heart because it solves a real problem in my country.  
It is also my strongest motivation for applying to the Eiffel Excellence Scholarship 2026 — I want to keep building AI solutions that create social impact in Bangladesh.
